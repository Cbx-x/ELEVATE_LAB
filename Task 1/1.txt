Interview Ques:

1️. What is an open port?

A port in LISTEN state where a service accepts connections.

2️. How does Nmap perform SYN scan?

By sending SYN packets and analyzing SYN-ACK responses without completing handshake.

3️. Risks of open ports?

Unauthorized access, service exploitation, information leakage.

4️. TCP vs UDP scan?

TCP: Connection-oriented
UDP: Connectionless, slower, less reliable detection

5️. How to secure open ports?

Disable unused services

Use firewall rules

Implement IDS/IPS

Use strong authentication

6️. Firewall role?

Filters inbound/outbound traffic based on rules.

7️. Why attackers perform port scans?

To identify attack vectors and vulnerable services.

8. How Wireshark complements scanning?

It verifies packet-level behavior of scan techniques.
